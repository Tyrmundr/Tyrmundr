- Hello there, I'm David!
- I’m interested in learning web-dev for the moment starting with reviewing and recreating many of the projects and lessons of TOP.
- I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. I've actually used these but this time I'm taking it properly seriously.
- I’m looking to collaborate on...well I'm not sure yet. I'll be upgrading this once I get some ideas! So far I just like the idea of building beautiful sites.
- How to reach me: via email: taki.96061@gmail.com.
