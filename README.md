Hello there, I'm David!

I’m interested in learning web-dev for the moment starting with reviewing and recreating many of the projects and lessons of TOP.
Currently learning JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. I've actually used these but this time I'm taking it properly seriously and/or slowly.

Right now I just want to be able to get a job and start building beautiful sites!

Reach me via email: taki.96061@gmail.com.
